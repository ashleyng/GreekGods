greekgods-parse
====================

### App
Just a simple iOS app to get familiar with retreiving, adding, and altering data in a database as well as uploading images. This was done to compare and contrast the ease of use of Parse and Firebase. The Firebase app can be found [here](https://github.com/ashleyng/greek-gods). A review is in the works.

### Tools
 - [Parse](https://www.parse.com/)
 - [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
